title: ES2018 features - rest / spread object properties

The rest / spread operators enable composing properties into objects _(rest)_ and expanding out object properties _(spread)_.<!--more-->

More detailed definitions are as follows: -
> Rest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern. Those keys and their values are copied onto a new object.

and
> Spread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.

These operators already exist for arrays as rest / spread elements, they were added as part of ES6 some years back.
This feature is now being added for objects.

### Syntax
The syntax is three dots followed by specific object `...<Binding Identifier>`

#### Rest
```js
  const o  = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
  const { a , b ,  ...x } = o;  // rest
  console.log(x); // { c: 3, d: 4 }
```

#### Spread
```js
  const o = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
  const x = { i: 5, ...o }; // spread
  console.log(x) // { i: 5, a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

#### Important Notes
- These only iterate over own properties, so prototype properties won't be accessed.
- Only enumerable properties are iterated over.

### Usecases

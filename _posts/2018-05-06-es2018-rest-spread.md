title: ES2018 features - rest / spread object properties
published: true

The new rest / **spread object operators** were added to the language as part of the recent es2018 release.
These operators already exist for arrays as rest / spread elements, as they were added as part of ES6 spec a few years back.

They enable **composing properties into objects _(rest)_** and **expanding out object properties _(spread)_**.<!--more-->

 More detailed explanations found are as follows: -
> Rest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern. Those keys and their values are copied onto a new object.

and
> Spread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.

The syntax is simply three dots followed by specific identifier i.e. `...<Binding Identifier>`

Here are some basic examples

#### Rest
```js
  const o  = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
  const { a , b ,  ...x } = o;  // The rest of the properties (c and d)
                                // get composed into x
  console.log(x);               // => { c: 3, d: 4 }
```

#### Spread
```js
  const o = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
  const x = { i: 5, ...o };   // The properties in the object o (a, b and c)
                              // get expanded or spread out into x
  console.log(x)              // => { i: 5, a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

### Usecases
Lets see where these come in handy.

#### Notables
- These only iterate over own properties, so prototype properties won't be accessed.
- Only enumerable properties are iterated over.

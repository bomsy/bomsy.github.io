The rest / spread object operators were added to the language as part of the ES2018 specification.

<!--more-->

These operators already exist for arrays as rest / spread elements, added as part of ES6 version of the specification a few years back.

They enable _composing properties into objects called **rest**_ and _expanding out object properties called **spread**_.

More detailed explanations found are as follows: -

> Rest properties collect the remaining own enumerable property keys that are not already picked off by the destructuring pattern. Those keys and their values are copied onto a new object.

and

> Spread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.

The syntax is simply three dots followed by specific identifier i.e. `...<Binding Identifier>`

Here are some basic examples

#### Rest

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
// The rest of the properties (c and d)
const { a, b, ...x } = o;
// get composed into x
console.log(x); // => { c: 3, d: 4 }
```

#### Spread

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
// The properties in the object o (a, b and c)
const x = { i: 5, ...o };
// get expanded or spread out into x
console.log(x); // => { i: 5, a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

### Usecases

Lets see where these come in handy.

#### Notables

- These only iterate over own properties, so prototype properties won't be accessed.
- Only enumerable properties are iterated over.
